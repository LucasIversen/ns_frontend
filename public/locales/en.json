  "aboutUsOne": "Nordic Storm is the first professional American Football team in the Nordic countries.",
  "aboutUsTwo": "It was founded in 2024 by a group of Danish business professionals with a glowing passion for American Football.",
  "aboutUsThree": "They all have a personal connection with the sport. Some of them played American Football when they studied in the US, others have family members who are active players. Several have held leadership roles in American Football clubs in the Danish National League.",
  "aboutUsFour": "As they came to know each other, it became apparent that they all had the same dream of sharing their passion for American Football with many more people in the Nordic countries.",
  "aboutUsFive": "They concluded that the best way to ignite the passion was to create a professional football team that Nordic fans could identify with and be proud of. Copenhagen was chosen as its home because of the sizeable Danish and Swedish fan base in the Ã˜resund region, strong local teams, and easy accessibility. Their aim was to attract both players and fans from all the Nordic countries.",
  "aboutUsSix": "They raised the capital needed and pitched their plans and visions to the leadership of the European League of Football (ELF). On 22 September 2024, the ELF announced that Nordic Storm would join the league from the 2025 season as the first team from the Nordic countries.",
  "aboutUsSeven": "Ambitions are high for the team's performance. From the outset, the mission is to make Nordic Storm a regular ELF playoff contender by 2030. This will require a professional coaching setup, and a strong squad comprised of the Nordic region's best homegrown talents supplemented with elite-level American and other European players.",
  "aboutUsEight": "Beyond the ambitions for success in the ELF lies a broader vision.",
  "aboutUsNine": "All great sports start with kids wanting to give the sport a try and meeting an inclusive learning environment in which they can develop, have fun, and shine. This requires well-run local clubs and dedicated coaches, who help them develop their sporting and social skills. As well as a tournament structure that allows players of all ages to compete with other teams at their level.",
  "aboutUsTen": "In the Nordic countries, this ecosystem is still in its infancy. Nordic Storm will spearhead the development of American Football and its biggest talents in the Nordic countries and thereby create a positive momentum for the sport at all levels. That's our vision.",
  "aboutUsEleven": "The Nordic countries have an amazing ability to deliver above what could be expected of such small nations. In American Football, our national teams and players are already doing remarkably well in European competitions.",
  "aboutUsTwelve": "With the formation of the Nordic Storm, the sky is the limit.",
